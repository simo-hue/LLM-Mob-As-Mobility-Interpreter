These places have been visited multiple times across different days of the week and times of the day. Additionally, considering the recent context stays, the user has visited places with IDs 767, 1157, and 1534. Therefore, it is likely that the user's next place will be one of the top 10 most frequently visited places, which are 730, 1333, 767, 877, 1814, 465, 3514, 836, 369, and 240."

Additionally, considering the recent context stays, the user has visited places with IDs 1157, 1534, and 767. Therefore, the next most likely place for the user to visit would be one of the places they have previously visited, with a higher probability for places 730, 1333, 767, 877, 3514, 1814, 369, 1120, 836, and 240."
