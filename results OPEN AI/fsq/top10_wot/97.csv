The user has also recently visited place_id 869, 162, and 627. Considering the context stays, the user has been to place_id 3436 on the same day and time as the next_place_id context stay. Therefore, it is likely that the user's next_place_id will be 3436. However, since the user has also visited place_id 2323 and 2914 frequently, they are also likely options for the next_place_id."

These places are visited on multiple days of the week and at different times of the day. Additionally, the recent context stays in <context> provide further evidence that the user is likely to visit place ID 3436 next, as it was visited on Tuesday at 11:00 AM. Other likely places include place IDs 2323, 2914, and 1370, which have also been visited recently. Place IDs 869, 162, 627, 29, and 1147 are also included in the prediction as they have been visited in the past, although less frequently. Place ID 1 is included as a possibility, as it was visited on Tuesday at 7:10 PM, which is similar to the current day and time. Overall, the prediction is based on the user's historical activity pattern and recent context stays."
