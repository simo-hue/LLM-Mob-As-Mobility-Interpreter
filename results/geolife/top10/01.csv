Additionally, the user has recently been to place 17 and 1 in the <context> stays. Considering the temporal information of the target stay, which is on a Friday at 4:39 AM, it is likely that the user is either on their way to work or returning home from a night out. Therefore, places 17 and 1, which are both work-related locations, are highly probable. Place 10 is also a possibility as it has been frequently visited in the past and is a popular location for social activities during the night."
