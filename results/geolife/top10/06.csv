Additionally, the recent context stays in <context> also include visits to place 225. Considering the temporal information of the target stay, which is on a Tuesday at 3:22 AM, it is likely that the user is either at a 24-hour establishment such as a convenience store or a late-night food place, or at a place that is open for overnight activities such as a casino or a nightclub. Therefore, we predict that the user's next location is most likely to be one of the top 10 places that are open 24 hours or have late-night activities, including places 225, 224, 101, 233, 235, 234, 180, 59, 236, and 229."

Other possible places include 233, 235, and 234, which are also frequently visited by the user. Places 180, 59, 236, and 229 are also possible options based on the user's historical stays and the temporal information of the target stay."

Considering the temporal information of the target stay, which is on a Wednesday at 1:39 AM, it is likely that the user is either at a late-night establishment or at home. Therefore, we also include place 101, which is a residential area. Other possible places include 233, which is a shopping mall, and 180, which is a park. Places 235 and 234 are also included as they are in close proximity to the frequently visited places 225 and 224. Finally, we include places 229 and 236 as they are also late-night establishments.

Additionally, place 101 and 233 have also been visited recently, and they are similar to the user's historical stay patterns. Places 235 and 180 have also been visited before, and they are close to the time and day of the target stay. Places 234 and 59 have been visited before, but they are less likely because they are not as close in time or day to the target stay.
