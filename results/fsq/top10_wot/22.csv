These two places have been visited multiple times on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Additionally, the recent context stays also include place ID 564, indicating that it is still a likely destination for the user. Place ID 1467 has also been visited multiple times, making it a probable destination. Place ID 1373 has been visited once in the recent context stays, suggesting it as a potential next location. Place ID 439 and place ID 300 have been visited once in the historical stays, making them less likely but still possible destinations. Finally, place ID 564 appears multiple times in the top 10 predictions, indicating its high probability as the next place for the user."
