The target stay's time (07:37 PM) and day of week (Monday) are similar to the recent context stays, which suggests a high probability of visiting places that were visited recently. The duration of the previous stays at these places was generally short (e.g., 691-1295 minutes), so it is likely that this user will visit one of these places for a relatively short stay as well."

The weekend stay duration also suggests a visit to a longer-staying location like 2607. Additionally, Thursday evening activities suggest visits to shorter-staying locations like 1295."
