103,1358,"[1, 51, 419, 610, 2, 3789, 2103, 4, 721, 1649]","The prediction is based on the user's activity pattern and recent context. Monday and Friday are the most frequent days in both history and context, so places visited during these days are favored. Places with higher frequencies and shorter durations (e.g., <1 hour) in the history are also more likely to be visited again. The target stay is afternoon on a Monday, which makes place 1649 and places visited recently in the context more likely."
