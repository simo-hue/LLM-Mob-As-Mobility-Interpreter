276,86,"[1380, 417, 360, 2252, 244, 2285, 3392, 664, 417, 1380]","Based on the user's historical stays, the most frequently visited places are 1380, 417, and 360. Additionally, considering the recent context stays, the user has visited place 2252, 244, and 2285. Therefore, the next most likely places for the user to visit are 1380, 417, 360, 2252, 244, 2285, 3392, 664, 417, and 1380."
276,154,"[1380, 417, 360, 244, 2252, 3392, 2285, 664, 138, 1830]","Based on the user's historical stays, we can observe that the user frequently visits certain places at specific times. For example, the user has visited place 1380 multiple times on Fridays at around 5 PM. Therefore, it is likely that the user will visit place 1380 again in the future. Similarly, the user has visited places 417, 360, 244, 2252, 3392, 2285, 664, 138, and 1830 multiple times at specific times and days of the week, indicating a pattern in their activity. Considering the recent context stays, we can also take into account the user's most recent visits to places 2252, 438, and 86. However, since the historical stays provide a more comprehensive view of the user's activity pattern, we prioritize the places that have been visited more frequently in the past."
