Additionally, considering the recent context stays, the user has visited places 3226 and 506. Therefore, the next most likely places for the user to visit are 3228, 2329, 928, 3610, 2481, 2061, 3226, 3190, 2771, and 1816."

Additionally, place 3610 has been visited twice, making it the second most likely place. Place 2329 and 928 have also been visited multiple times, making them likely choices. The recent context stays in <context> show that the user has visited place 3226 and 506, which increases the probability of visiting these places again. Therefore, these places are included in the prediction as well."
