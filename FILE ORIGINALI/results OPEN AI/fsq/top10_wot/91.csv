The user has visited place 3104 multiple times on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Place 2104 is also visited frequently, especially on Fridays. Considering the recent context stays, the user has visited place 3104 and place 2104 in the past few days. Therefore, it is highly likely that the user's next place will be either place 3104 or place 2104. Additionally, the user has also visited place 1 and place 1050 in the past, so these places are also included in the prediction. However, based on the user's activity pattern and recent context, place 3104 and place 2104 are the most probable next locations."

Considering the recent context stays, the user has visited place 2104 and 3104. Therefore, it is likely that the next place the user will visit is either 3104 or 2104. Additionally, place 1 has been visited multiple times in the past, so it is also a probable next location. Place 1050 has been visited once recently, so it is also a possibility. However, based on the user's activity pattern, places 3104 and 2104 are more likely to be the next destinations."
91,2104,"[3104, 2104, 1, 1050]","Based on the user's historical stays, the most frequently visited place is place ID 3104, followed by place ID 2104. The user has also visited place ID 1 and place ID 1050. Considering the recent context stays, the user has visited place ID 2104 and place ID 3104. Therefore, the next most likely places for the user to visit are place ID 3104, place ID 2104, place ID 1, and place ID 1050."

These predictions are made considering the user's repeated visits to places 3104 and 2104 in the past, as well as the recent context stays at places 3104 and 2104. Additionally, place 1 is included as it has been visited in the past and is also present in the recent context stays. Place 1050 is included as it was visited once in the past. The other places in the prediction are also based on the user's historical stays and the assumption that the user's activity pattern will continue."

Additionally, the user has recently visited place 2104 multiple times in the context stays. Therefore, it is highly likely that the next place the user will visit is either 3104 or 2104. Place 1 is also a possibility as it has been visited in the past. Place 1050 is included as it was visited once in the past. The other places have not been visited recently or frequently, so their probabilities are lower."
