Place 3018 is also likely as the user has visited it on multiple occasions. Place 1 is another probable location as it has been visited frequently. Additionally, place 3036 and 1883 have been visited multiple times as well. Places 1761, 1627, 1513, 3197, and 1679 are also likely based on the user's activity pattern."
95,300,"[3006, 3018, 1, 3036, 1883, 1761, 1627, 1513, 3197, 1679]","Based on the user's historical stays, we can see that they have frequently visited places with IDs 3006, 3018, 1, 3036, and 1883. These places are likely to be the user's preferred locations. Additionally, considering the recent context stays, the user has visited places with IDs 1761, 1627, 1513, 3197, and 1679. These places are also likely to be the user's next destinations as they have been recently visited. Therefore, the top 10 most likely places for the user's next visit are 3006, 3018, 1, 3036, 1883, 1761, 1627, 1513, 3197, and 1679."
