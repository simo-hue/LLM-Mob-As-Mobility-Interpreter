These two places have the highest probability of being the next place the user will visit. Additionally, the user has also visited place IDs 2885, 3042, 420, 600, 943, 461, 728, and 343 in the past, which suggests that these places are also likely to be visited next."

Additionally, the recent context stays indicate that the user has been to places with IDs 1025, 3171, and 2885. Therefore, it is likely that the user's next place will be one of these frequently visited or recently visited places."

These places are likely to be the user's next destination as they have shown a pattern of visiting them in the past. Additionally, the recent context stays in <context> also include visits to places with IDs 3042, 943, and 3042, further supporting the prediction of these places as the user's next location."
