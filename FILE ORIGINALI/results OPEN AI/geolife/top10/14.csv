Additionally, the contextual information shows that the user has recently visited place 17 multiple times on Thursday. Considering the temporal information of the target stay, which is on a Friday at 1:03 AM, it is likely that the user is either returning to a familiar place (such as 17 or 18) after a night out or going to a late-night establishment (such as 10 or 1).
